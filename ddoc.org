* Design Goals
** First, do no grind
      - Anything that doesn't involve thought or planning should be
        automated.
      - Anything that has to be done by the player should be either
        interesting or over quickly.
** Try to do everything in-world
      - If possible, all inputs should be handled through in-world
        interaction (drop item into hopper|place item next to other
        item|click on object with empty hand)
      - Use the "blue input, orange output" standard to make transition from
        modded MC to this game easier
      - May need some kind of hint on world start, i.e., "place the stone and
        stick on a stone to make your first pick"
