* Design Goals
** First, do no grind
- Anything that doesn't involve thought or planning should be
  automated.
- Anything that has to be done by the player should be either
  interesting or over quickly.
** Try to do everything in-world
- If possible, all inputs should be handled through in-world
  interaction (drop item into hopper|place item next to other
  item|click on object with empty hand)
- Use the "blue input, orange output" standard to make transition from
  modded MC to this game easier
- May need some kind of hint on world start, i.e., "place the stone and
  stick on a stone to make your first pick"
** Everything needs a mechanic.
- If it isn't gonna have a unique mechanic, maybe it shouldn't be here.
- Each thing in the game needs something that makes you *think* about
  it.
- Example: Blocks fall without supports, making building complicated.
- Example: Steam has certain movement patterns and powers turbines it
  runs into.
- Example: Combat is full of slow projectiles and patterns.
* Specific mechanics
** Crafting
*** Basic crafting
- Basic item crafting involves two main steps and one preparatory step
- First, you need a work surface. Different crafting recipes can
  require certain work surfaces (i.e., tools require a stone block as
  an 'anvil')
- Then, place items on the work surface. More space may be needed for
  larger recipes. Items should be handled as a special block type to
  accomodate this.
- Finally, shift+click on the items to get the result (key combo is
  subject to change).
