* Design Goals
** First, do no grind
      - Anything that doesn't involve thought or planning should be
        automated.
      - Anything that has to be done by the player should be either
        interesting or over quickly.
** Try to do everything in-world
      - If possible, all inputs should be handled through in-world
        interaction (drop item into hopper|place item next to other
        item|click on object with empty hand)
      - Use the "blue input, orange output" standard to make transition from
        modded MC to this game easier
      - May need some kind of hint on world start, i.e., "place the stone and
        stick on a stone to make your first pick"
** Everything needs a mechanic.
      - If it isn't gonna have a unique mechanic, maybe it shouldn't be here.
      - Each thing in the game needs something that makes you *think* about
        it.
      - Example: Blocks fall without supports, making building complicated.
      - Example: Steam has certain movement patterns and powers turbines it
        runs into.
      - Example: Combat is full of slow projectiles and patterns.
